Practicing with node app/server/mods/react

Potential Project for portfolio in the future. A RESTful api on the back end, which will allow users to operate with CRUD requests. The main ideas are to let users provide an image of the game(either screen shot or cover art), and leave a review along with a rating(1-5). Basic auth using Jwt and Express validator.
